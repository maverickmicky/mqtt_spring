# mqtt_spring

MQTT publisher and subscriber configuration using Springboot2

It is using sandbox provided by eclipse: iot.eclipse.org

You can try MQTT client to test this application. I personally used Java Swing Application which can be downloaded from https://www.eclipse.org/paho/components/tool/

Add GH Actions.
